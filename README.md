# Next Steps

Our biggest priority for the future of Murder Hospital is to make it multi-player using Socket.io. The multiplayer version will have the following additional features:
- Users can create a private room to play with up to 6 friends.
- They can also select an avatar to play as
- Chat with other players to discuss clues and strategies

In addition to multiplayer-functionality, we'd also like to add the following:
- Text animation for the pop-up messages
- Randomize the clue colliders and clues to allow for repeat play
